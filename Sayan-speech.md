Firtsly, Whole marketing process can be divided into 3 sub-process: 
1) Early publicity: Includes brand promotion and customer development
2) Mid-term sales: Deals with customers at the sales-place, conversation with customers towards a successful sale

the target customers. <br/> 
Which causes in extensive advertisement, low accuracy, increased cost and finally unable to improve sales. <br/>
