-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
As a new marketing model, the key to big data marketing is to quickly reflect all kinds of data and 
information, and transfer the effective product information or advertising information to the potential
customer groups through effective carriers at the right time and in a reasonable way. Enterprises need
to change the traditional marketing mode into a precision marketing mode. The concept of precision
marketing was first formally proposed by Philip Kotler,an American marketing author, in 2005.
He believed that enterprises need precision marketing with measurable and high return on investment,
and also need to develop marketing plans that focus on results and actions.

2) Accurate push based on big data mining
3) Fine management based on big data application

consumers and competitors. Based on the development of automotive electronic technology,
sensors and chips are widely used in the production and manufacturing of automobiles. 
Enterprises can use sensors and chips to collect and sort out the relevant data, and analyze the 
performance of automobiles based on these data, and comprehensively grasp the behavior and 
habits of consumers, and then in the follow-up process of automobile research and development,
the basis for Consumers like to improve and innovate automobile R & D, so as to achieve the 
precise positioning of the developed products, and effectively enhance the competitive advantage of 
enterprises while meeting the needs of customers.

such as consumers' interests and hobbies, brand concerns, search content, regional attributes, 
consumption ability, social habits, etc., so as to realize the mining of consumer consumption

automobile website. Each user sees the same push content and ranking order. It is pushed 
according to the number of hits, industry hot spots, comments and collections. The personalized 
recommendation method, each netizen sees the content, the sorting way is not the same, 
the recommendation principle is according to the user's portrait tag matching recommendation.

of data collection and processing customer information, vehicle information, procurement information,
transaction information, production information, etc. Based on this, automobile enterprises can use 
big data technology to construct big data platform, so as to provide basis and suggestions for relevant
decision-making of automobile enterprises. Therefore, in the specific process of precision marketing,
the top management of enterprises should focus on the integration of data and the construction
